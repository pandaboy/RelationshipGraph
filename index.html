            What is this?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The RelationshipGraph is an Artificial Intelligence model for use in
            games that makes use of an extended graph model to allow for complex
            relationships to emerge.
          </p>

          <h3>
            <a id="extended-graph-model" class="anchor" href="#extended-graph-model" aria-hidden="true">
              <span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
            </a>
            An Extended Graph Model? Did you make that up?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Yes, I did. At the core of the RelationshipGraph is a standard graph
            model, it has Nodes and Edges and all that jazz. And while this is useful
            for a basic model of relationships (Alice is related to Bob), it
            doesn't allow for more complex relationships and knowledge. So the
            standard graph was extended like so:
          </p>
          <p>
            <img src="images/simple_graph_diagram.jpg" alt="Extended Graph Image">
          </p>
          <p>
            So a Node can track an Edge between two other Node's. I call this an
            Indirect Edge, as neither Node in the Edge refers to the owner of the
            Edge. This simply means that Charles "knows" that Alice is related to Bob.
            This simple addition can be manipulated for some advanced behaviour
            that you can see in some of the demos.
          </p>

          <h3>
            So what can I do with this?
          </h3>
          <p>
            You can have characters in your game that are aware of the
            relationships between others and makes their decisions based on that.
            For example, at a market if a seller knows your character regularly
            buys from a competitor, they might offer steeper discounts. Or you
            could "lie" to characters and provide them with false relationships
            about other characters.
            Or you could just use the graph to determine standard relationships
            among your game characters i.e. These are enemies of this other character.
          </p>

          <h3>
            That's it?
          </h3>
          <p>
            There's some additional functionality to allow messaging through the
            graph, relationships to groups and to track previous relationships
            (similar to memory). But those aren't the main focus of the
            RelationshipGraph.
          </p>

          <p>
            It's all Brendan O'Connor's
            (<a href="https://github.com/pandaboy" class="user-mention">@pandaboy</a>)
            fault. You can ask him why he thinks this is a good idea. This was his
            dissertation project at Trinity College Dublin, and he has unwisely
            chosen to expand it some more.
