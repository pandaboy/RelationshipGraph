# RelationshipGraph
Believable Social Dynamics based on a Relationship Model.

## Overview
Interactions between characters in games is rigidly defined; there's limited
scope for character relationships to evolve as a result of interactions with
each other or other factors (or items/events).

This limited ability hinders player immersion and believability in their
interactions with the characters.

The RelationshipGraph supports characters that store their own ”assumed
knowledge” of other characters relationships, in addition to their own direct
relationships with other characters.

This allows the characters to have awareness of not just their own relationships
with other characters (e.g. to a sibling or child character), but also awareness
of the relationships between other characters (e.g. that two other characters
may be enemies). This knowledge can (and should) be treated as an assumption;
allowing characters to be provided with misleading information - the results of
which are left up to extended implementations of the model.
